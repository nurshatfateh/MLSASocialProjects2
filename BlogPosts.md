Digital Accessibility is all about making sure that all users can get full access to digital content regardless of their impairments. The current era is called the era of digital media. More and more people are relying on digital services for work, entertainment etc. Literally everything we do in our life is somehow related to digital services these days. Today, a lot of digital interfaces are created with a focus heavily on the visual impact they are having but digital accessibility is mostly overlooked. This ignorance leads to a huge portion of the people getting deprived of accessing digital contents. It means people with disabilities can't do even basic things such as attending online classes, socializing with friends online, using government services and so on. It is totally unexpected as so many people rely on digital services these days for even basic day to day activities. Thus, digital accessibility is crucial for creating an inclusive world for everyone.

## What is Digital Accessibility? 
<br>

Accessibility is ensuring that devices, products and environments are convenient for all users despite any impairments they might have. The concept of digital accessibility is pretty much similar. Digital accessibility allows everyone to have full access to digital content despite their impairments. It refers to how usable a website, app or digital service is to all sort of users including disabled people. For example, a website must be navigable using keyboard for users who might not be able to operate a mouse. If a website has only one way of navigation, then it might be inaccessible for a significant portion of people. Thus, it is important to ensure multiple ways of navigation.

## Principles of Digital Accessibility 
<br>

There are four principles of web accessibility by the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). These are: 

1. Perceivable: Users must be able to perceive the information being presented.  

2. Operable: Users must be able to interact with the interface. 

3. Understandable: Users must be able to understand the information and the operation of the interface. 

4. Robust: The content should be accessible by wide variety of technologies. 

The lack of any one of these principles will make the web less accessible.

## Examples of Digital Accessibility

Some common digital accessibility features are: 
<br>
<br>

-> All functionalities should be accessible by keyboard. 

-> Screen reading functionalities should be provided. 

-> Alt texts should be provided for all images. 

-> Subtitles should be provided for videos. 

-> Hyperlinks should be properly formatted. 

-> Each page on a website should give a consistent user experience.

## Why Ensure Digital Accessibility?

The question shouldn’t be why ensure digital accessibility. The question should be why not ensure digital accessibility starting from right now? Nearly 20% of the people living with a disability. Not everyone can easily access all the digital services. As our world has digitalized dramatically in the last few decades, it has become more important than ever before to focus on digital accessibility right now. Ensuring digital accessibility means ensuring equal access to online education, health care, e-commerce, employment and so on. It is our moral obligation to ensure digital accessibility. 

Now let’s talk about business perspectives. Digital accessibility is a huge boost for business. For example, YouTube has subtitles for videos which makes it more accessible for people. It leads to more users, which translates into profit. People are more likely to spend more money in services which are easily accessible. Ensuring digital accessibility is also a very good SEO practice too.  

Ensuring digital accessibility proves that a company is professional and cares about user experience which helps a company’s business to boom.

<br>

The capabilities of digital devices and services are increasing rapidly day by day. But sadly, it is not the same when it comes to digital accessibility. There are many challenges of ensuring digital accessibility. In this article, we will be discussing few of these challenges and possible solutions to overcome these challenges. <br><br> 

## Challenges of Digital Accessibility 
<br>

### Lack of awareness 

The major issue of ensuring digital accessibility is lack of awareness. Most digital service providers and developers are not concerned about digital accessibility. Most of them don’t even know the term ‘Digital Accessibility’ which is the most alarming fact.   

### Lack of willpower & motivation  

Accessibility is often seen as a niche requirement. Many developers know the guidelines of digital accessibility but still lack the motivation and willpower to go one extra mile to ensure digital accessibility. 

 



### Compliance Culture  

Many developers are only concerned about fulfilling minimum requirements to get their service online. They are just happy to comply with the minimum requirements instead of truly implementing and testing digital accessibility features. 

### Lack of skills and resources  

Lack of skills and resources are also major barriers. Most developers are not skilled enough to implement accessibility features. Resource limitation is a major factor too. 

### Lack of governance  

Though there are guidelines like ‘Web Content Accessibility Guidelines’ (WCAG), there is clearly a lack of governance when it comes to ensuring digital accessibility. Most of the digital services lack accessibility features and still they are not held accountable for this. 
<br><br>
## Possible Solutions

### Raising awareness 

The best and primary way to solve any problem is raising awareness and educating people about the cause. Same goes for digital accessibility. We must educate people about the importance of ensuring digital accessibility. Society can’t function properly by depriving a huge percentage of disabled people from accessing digital services. Thus, we must promote inclusiveness. 

### Focusing on UX design 

More focus must be given to UX design. User experience should be the priority before implementing any digital service. An inclusive design strategy must be adopted. 

### Skill Development 

As mentioned earlier, lack of skill is also a major barrier. So, necessary training should be given to developers so that they become capable enough to implement digital accessibility features. 

### Improving Governance 

More regulations and guidelines should be provided for ensuring digital accessibility. These rules and regulations must be strictly imposed and monitored. 

### Progressing from Compliance to Real Accessibility	 

Only abiding by the regulations is not good enough. Digital accessibility features must be tested on a pool of disabled people to get real life feedbacks. Only then can real accessibility be ensured.
