# 1. Digital Accessibility 
<br>
<img src="1.jpg" width="400"/><br>
Digital Accessibility is all about making sure that all users can get full access to digital content regardless of their impairments. The current era is called the era of digital media. More and more people are relying on digital services for work, entertainment etc. Literally everything we do in our life is somehow related to digital services these days. Today, a lot of digital interfaces are created with a focus heavily on the visual impact they are having but digital accessibility is mostly overlooked. This ignorance leads to a huge portion of the people getting deprived of accessing digital contents. It means people with disabilities can't do even basic things such as attending online classes, socializing with friends online, using government services and so on. It is totally unexpected as so many people rely on digital services these days for even basic day to day activities. Thus, digital accessibility is crucial for creating an inclusive world for everyone.

## What is Digital Accessibility? 
<br>
<img src="3.jpg" width="400"/><br>
Accessibility is ensuring that devices, products and environments are convenient for all users despite any impairments they might have. The concept of digital accessibility is pretty much similar. Digital accessibility allows everyone to have full access to digital content despite their impairments. It refers to how usable a website, app or digital service is to all sort of users including disabled people. For example, a website must be navigable using keyboard for users who might not be able to operate a mouse. If a website has only one way of navigation, then it might be inaccessible for a significant portion of people. Thus, it is important to ensure multiple ways of navigation.

## Principles of Digital Accessibility 
<br>
<img src="4.jpg" width="400"/><br>
There are four principles of web accessibility by the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). These are: 

1. Perceivable: Users must be able to perceive the information being presented.  

2. Operable: Users must be able to interact with the interface. 

3. Understandable: Users must be able to understand the information and the operation of the interface. 

4. Robust: The content should be accessible by wide variety of technologies. 

The lack of any one of these principles will make the web less accessible. 
<br><br><br>



## Examples of Digital Accessibility 
<br>

Some common digital accessibility features are: 
<br>
<br>

-> All functionalities should be accessible by keyboard. 

-> Screen reading functionalities should be provided. 

-> Alt texts should be provided for all images. 

-> Subtitles should be provided for videos. 

-> Hyperlinks should be properly formatted. 

-> Each page on a website should give a consistent user experience.

## Why Ensure Digital Accessibility? 
<br>

The question shouldn’t be why ensure digital accessibility. The question should be why not ensure digital accessibility starting from right now? Nearly 20% of the people living with a disability. Not everyone can easily access all the digital services. As our world has digitalized dramatically in the last few decades, it has become more important than ever before to focus on digital accessibility right now. Ensuring digital accessibility means ensuring equal access to online education, health care, e-commerce, employment and so on. It is our moral obligation to ensure digital accessibility. 

Now let’s talk about business perspectives. Digital accessibility is a huge boost for business. For example, YouTube has subtitles for videos which makes it more accessible for people. It leads to more users, which translates into profit. People are more likely to spend more money in services which are easily accessible. Ensuring digital accessibility is also a very good SEO practice too.  

Ensuring digital accessibility proves that a company is professional and cares about user experience which helps a company’s business to boom.

The most important thing to realize is digital accessibility is not an optional thing anymore. As the world has digitalized dramatically, the need for ensuring digital accessibility has skyrocketed. It has become a fundamental right for all kinds of people to get equal opportunity to access digital services. There are several worldwide regulations, guidelines and standards that protect the rights of disabled people. Thus, ensuring digital accessibility is not just a moral obligation but also a responsibility too.

# 2. Current Challenges of Digital Accessibility & Possible Solutions 
<br>
<img src="11.jpg" width="400"/><br>
The capabilities of digital devices and services are increasing rapidly day by day. But sadly, it is not the same when it comes to digital accessibility. There are many challenges of ensuring digital accessibility. In this article, we will be discussing few of these challenges and possible solutions to overcome these challenges. <br><br><br> 

## Challenges of Digital Accessibility 
<br>
<img src="22.png" width="400"/><br>

### Lack of awareness 

The major issue of ensuring digital accessibility is lack of awareness. Most digital service providers and developers are not concerned about digital accessibility. Most of them don’t even know the term ‘Digital Accessibility’ which is the most alarming fact.   

### Lack of willpower & motivation  

Accessibility is often seen as a niche requirement. Many developers know the guidelines of digital accessibility but still lack the motivation and willpower to go one extra mile to ensure digital accessibility. 

### Compliance Culture  

Many developers are only concerned about fulfilling minimum requirements to get their service online. They are just happy to comply with the minimum requirements instead of truly implementing and testing digital accessibility features. 

### Lack of skills and resources  

Lack of skills and resources are also major barriers. Most developers are not skilled enough to implement accessibility features. Resource limitation is a major factor too. 

### Lack of governance  

Though there are guidelines like ‘Web Content Accessibility Guidelines’ (WCAG), there is clearly a lack of governance when it comes to ensuring digital accessibility. Most of the digital services lack accessibility features and still they are not held accountable for this. 
<br><br><br>


## Possible Solutions 
<br>

### Raising awareness 

The best and primary way to solve any problem is raising awareness and educating people about the cause. Same goes for digital accessibility. We must educate people about the importance of ensuring digital accessibility. Society can’t function properly by depriving a huge percentage of disabled people from accessing digital services. Thus, we must promote inclusiveness. 

### Focusing on UX design 

More focus must be given to UX design. User experience should be the priority before implementing any digital service. An inclusive design strategy must be adopted. 

### Skill Development 

As mentioned earlier, lack of skill is also a major barrier. So, necessary training should be given to developers so that they become capable enough to implement digital accessibility features. 

### Improving Governance 

More regulations and guidelines should be provided for ensuring digital accessibility. These rules and regulations must be strictly imposed and monitored. 

### Progressing from Compliance to Real Accessibility	 

Only abiding by the regulations is not good enough. Digital accessibility features must be tested on a pool of disabled people to get real life feedbacks. Only then can real accessibility be ensured.

Achieving inclusion worldwide is a big and complex challenge. Same goes for Digital Inclusion too. But proper guidelines, awareness and skill development surely help to overcome all the obstacles of ensuring digital accessibility.

 # 5. Unboxing Windows 11
 <br>
 
In October 2021, Microsoft launched Windows 11, the most recent major release of its Windows NT operating system. It's a free upgrade from Windows 10 (2015), and it's accessible for any Windows 10 device that meets the new Windows 11 system requirements. Windows 11 was redesigned for productivity, creativity and ease of use.

Windows 11 includes a redesigned Start menu, the replacement of its "live tiles" with a separate "Widgets" panel on the taskbar, the ability to create tiled sets of windows that can be minimised and restored from the taskbar as a group, and new gaming technologies inherited from Xbox Series X and Series S such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage on compatible hardware. Like its predecessor, Windows 10, Internet Explorer (IE) has been replaced as the default web browser by the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge, and Microsoft Teams has been incorporated into the Windows shell. Microsoft also announced plans to allow more flexibility in software that can be distributed via Microsoft Store, and to support Android apps on Windows 11.
<br><br><br>


## Windows team's ambition: Beyond possible, efficient, and yes, delightful 
<br>

In the Windows team, they aspire to create efficient, fun and delightful experiences for people with disabilities and without. They root their ambition in the principles of inclusive design, which celebrates and draws inspiration from people with different abilities, needs and preferences.
<br><br><br>


## Windows 11 is the most inclusively designed version of Windows yet
<br>

Windows 11 was created with persons with disabilities in mind, supporting productivity, creativity, and simplicity of use. Windows adapts to you with a rich range of built-in and third-party accessibility capabilities. Assistive technologies such as Narrator, Magnifier, Closed Captions, and Windows Speech Recognition are included in Windows 11 to help users with a variety of disabilities. Assistive solutions created by partners, such as popular screen readers, magnification tools, CART services, speech commands, and other experiences, are also supported in Windows 11. Beyond designing for accessibility Microsoft employed Trusted Tester (Section 508 Trusted Tester Conformance Test Process Version 5 | Homeland Security (dhs.gov)) conformance tests, usability tests and other processes to help ensure Windows 11 is accessible at availability. 

With Windows 10, assistive technologies were made to work with secure applications like Word in Windows Defender Application Guard(WDAG). With Windows 11, it is now possible for both Microsoft and partner assistive technologies to work with applications like Outlook hosted in cloud, in Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)[Create Your Azure Free Account Today | Microsoft Azure]. Using Narrator, for example, Office may be accessed as a Remote Application Integrated Locally (RAIL) with Windows 11. While this may appear to most people to be a lot of jargon, it has a big impact. When they require it, blind people will be able to use Azure-hosted applications such as Office.

On devices that meet the app system requirements, Windows 11 will also enable Linux GUI apps like gedit via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). People who are blind, for example, can use WSL and Windows with supported screen readers. In certain circumstances, the integration of assistive technology is smooth. Color Filters, for example, "just work." Importantly, the WSL team prioritised accessibility from the start.
<br><br><br>


## Windows 11 for all
<br>

Not only is it free to get, it includes many improvements.

Do you have sight problems? Fret not! New sound schemes are included to make work easier. Windows 11 contains various sounds for more accessible Light and Dark Themes including a delightful start-up. People (like me!) who work for extended periods of time and light sensitive have the option to switch between various beautiful color themes, including new Dark themes and reimagined High Contrast Themes. The new Contrast Themes include aesthetically pleasing, customizable color combinations that make apps and content easier to see. It seems Aurora has shifted its location to my system!
Deaf and hard of hearing, language learners, and people in noisy or in quiet environments can enjoy redesigned Closed Caption themes that are easier to read and customize.
Additionally, a variety of users can take advantage of Windows Voice Typing, which recognizes voice, transcribes it, and automatically punctuates text using cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Voice typing is beneficial for those who have severe rheumatoid arthritis, repetitive stress injuries, cerebral palsy, and other mobility-related problems, as well as language learners, those with learning differences, including those who have significant spelling difficulties.
"People with disabilities do not need to be fixed: they need to be accepted for who they are." 
Says Jordan Christian, Apraxia & Mental Health Advocate. Microsoft have accepted everyone for who they are and ultimately, the simplified design and user experience of Windows 11 allows everyone to enjoy. It is modern, fresh, clean and beautiful.
<br><br><br>


## So many features, where can I find them all?
<br>

Hide all these awesome features under a bushel? NO NO NO!!! Microsoft has considered feedback from all of its users about its previous "Ease of Access" settings that its purpose and icon was unclear. So, they have rebranded Ease of Access Settings to Accessibility and introduced a new accessibility “human” icon. This redesign was to make them easier to use. And the best part is that, Accessibility features are available in the out of box experience and on the Log on and Lock screens so that users can independently setup and use their devices, e.g., with Narrator.
