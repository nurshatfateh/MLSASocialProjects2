Digital Accessibility is all about making sure that all users can get full access to digital content regardless of their impairments. The current era is called the era of digital media. More and more people are relying on digital services for work, entertainment etc. Literally everything we do in our life is somehow related to digital services these days. Today, a lot of digital interfaces are created with a focus heavily on the visual impact they are having but digital accessibility is mostly overlooked. This ignorance leads to a huge portion of the people getting deprived of accessing digital contents. It means people with disabilities can't do even basic things such as attending online classes, socializing with friends online, using government services and so on. It is totally unexpected as so many people rely on digital services these days for even basic day to day activities. Thus, digital accessibility is crucial for creating an inclusive world for everyone.

Accessibility is ensuring that devices, products and environments are convenient for all users despite any impairments they might have. The concept of digital accessibility is pretty much similar. Digital accessibility allows everyone to have full access to digital content despite their impairments. It refers to how usable a website, app or digital service is to all sort of users including disabled people. For example, a website must be navigable using keyboard for users who might not be able to operate a mouse. If a website has only one way of navigation, then it might be inaccessible for a significant portion of people. Thus, it is important to ensure multiple ways of navigation.

### Principles of Digital Accessibility

There are four principles of web accessibility by the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). These are: 

1. Perceivable: Users must be able to perceive the information being presented.  

2. Operable: Users must be able to interact with the interface. 

3. Understandable: Users must be able to understand the information and the operation of the interface. 

4. Robust: The content should be accessible by wide variety of technologies. 

The lack of any one of these principles will make the web less accessible.
