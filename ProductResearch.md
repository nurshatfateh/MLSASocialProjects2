### What is Digital Accessibility?

Digital accessibility is the process of making digital products such as websites, apps and other online tools accessible to a wide range of users including people with auditory, visual, motor or cognitive disabilities. In simple terms, digital accessibility means making digital products accessible to everyone.
There are many digital tools available to help someone with a disability to interact with digital devices and content without using traditional input methods. Screen reading software can help people with visual disabilities to understand digital content. Closed-captioned videos are helpful for people with hearing disabilities. There are many more examples such as these. But the fundamental target of digital accessibility remains the same and that is ensuring all users can access the same information regardless of their impairments.

### What is the need to focus on Digital Accessibility?

As the use of digital devices and the internet has increased, the need of improving digital accessibility features has skyrocketed day by day. Every person deserves equal accessibility privilege regardless of their impairments. It's everyone's right to access digital devices and content as technology has become an integral part of our regular life. Thus digital accessibility is an important topic to discuss. 
Improving accessibility features has some perks too. It helps to increase the audience and improves the user experience for everyone. Adding digital accessibility features can help to strengthen a brand's image and reputation. So before asking why do we need to focus on digital accessibility, ask why not?
