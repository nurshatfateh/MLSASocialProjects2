## UNBOX WINDOWS 11 - THE MOST ACCESSIBLE WINDOWS

### Prologue

Accessibility (ac·ces·si·bil·i·ty) defined as "the quality of being easy to obtain or use" or "the quality of being easily understood or appreciated". Acessibility also includes the way we can use something to reach other thing.
Accessibility history goes way back then. In 1957, there was an award for President Eisenhower, in recognition of his work to promote accessibility in his community. Accessibility movement (for wheelchair and stuff) has common roots with the civil rights movement and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [(link)](https://www.wbdg.org/design-objectives/accessible/history-accessible-facility-design). Today, as technology grows rapidly, it should be followed by making it more accessible. The accessibility is not only about something we can touch, but also the digital one.

### What is Digital Accessibility?

Digital accessibility is the process of making digital products such as websites, apps and other online tools accessible to a wide range of users including people with auditory, visual, motor or cognitive disabilities. In simple terms, digital accessibility means making digital products accessible to everyone.
There are many digital tools available to help someone with a disability to interact with digital devices and content without using traditional input methods. Screen reading software can help people with visual disabilities to understand digital content. Closed-captioned videos are helpful for people with hearing disabilities. There are many more examples such as these. But the fundamental target of digital accessibility remains the same and that is ensuring all users can access the same information regardless of their impairments.

### What is the need to focus on Digital Accessibility?

As the use of digital devices and the internet has increased, the need of improving digital accessibility features has skyrocketed day by day. Every person deserves equal accessibility privilege regardless of their impairments. It's everyone's right to access digital devices and content as technology has become an integral part of our regular life. Thus digital accessibility is an important topic to discuss.
Improving accessibility features has some perks too. It helps to increase the audience and improves the user experience for everyone. Adding digital accessibility features can help to strengthen a brand's image and reputation. So before asking why do we need to focus on digital accessibility, ask why not?

### Microsoft's role in this field

Microsoft's role and journey in accessibility, has gone a long way. In 1992, Microsoft established a full-time position focused on accessibility. For several years, Greg Lowney directed the accessibility effort. Access to Windows for computer users who are blind or visually impaired was a long time in coming. The first screen reader for a Windows operating system was not released until 1992 when Syntha-Voice Computers released SlimWare Window Bridge for Windows 3.1. It was developed without much help from Microsoft. Not only Windows, Microsoft has developed many applications with ultimate support for accessibility. One example, A Lecturer from ANU College Of Law, used Office and Seeing AI to facilitate the intreaction and collaboration between lectuter and students. Another example is a blind father uses accessible technologies like Office Lens and OneNote to quickly take control of a medical emergency involving his young daughter. Now in 2022, Microsoft is still working with the art of accessibility, continuing Windows accessibility in the Windows 11.

### Accessible features in Windows 11

Windows is a platform that is used daily by over a billion people worldwide. So it's very important to understand the impact poor usability and accessibility can have. This can even cause irritation for a normal user and can be a complete mess for the users who have additional needs preventing learning, creativity, enjoyment or employment. Microsoft has always made accessibility it's first thought and have filled Windows 11 with many new and updated accessibility features. Its predecessor Windows 10 included accessibility features such as magnifier, narrator, speech recognition and subtitles. Windows 11 has geared up to the next level with improvements across the board. Some of the major features are closed captions, voice typing, new accessibility settings area and contrast and dark mode. Start menu and search have been redesigned with a focus on making them accessible first.

### Summary

Thanks to the internet, the general concepts of accessibility which previously applied mostly to physical, private and public spaces, now applies to the digital world! It's our duty to consider accessibility concepts while designing and developing various products. The Internet continues to provide digital solutions to a wider audience, making it imperative for app, web and other software developers to incorporate digital accessibility.
